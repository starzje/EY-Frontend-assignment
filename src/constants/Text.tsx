    <p>
      Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they were once valued for their hunting abilities, they
      are now valued for their companionship and loving behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and kittens are a clowder of cats and a kindle of
      kittens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from large cats such as lions and tigers because they are
      naturally active at night and can purr.
    </p>
    <p>Cats are now the most popular pet in the UK and in the US.</p>

    <p>
      Domestic dogs have been companions to people for more than 15,000 years. There are more than 400 different breeds
      of dogs. PAWS or your local animal shelter has a wide variety of breeds available for adoption. The most popular
      types are the non-pedigree. They are extra special because they are one-of-a-kind!
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, small dogs live longer than large dogs. Small dogs such as terriers may live 20 years. Giant dogs like
      Great Danes may live eight years. The average lifespan for a mixed breed dog is 13 to 14 years. By making sure
      dogs have good food, regular veterinary care, shelter and a loving family, they will live longer, healthier lives.
