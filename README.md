npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in development mode. The browser should automatically open the app at http://localhost:9000. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the dist folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint to check your code for potential issues and enforce consistent code style.

### `npm run prettier`

Runs Prettier to automatically format your code according to the project's style guidelines.
